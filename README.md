## Overview

R is a complete, flexible and open source system for statistical analysis and graphics, which has become a tool of choice for biologists and biomedical scientists who need to analyse and visualise their experimental data. This is short day webinar designed for biomedical scientists who are newbies to R & RStudio (an integrated development environment for R). Participants will receive example data sets to practise data clearning, data exploration and data visualisation (ggplot2). If you want to transition from coding in base R to the tidyverse, or just jump into doing data science in the tidyverse without any prior R experience, this is the webinar for you! 

## Audience
 
This "Introduction to use of R in Data Analysis" two-hours webinar course is design to provide the participants skill set required to generate intuitive graphics from their laboratory experiments. 

## Learning objectives

At the end of this webinar course, participants should be comfortable with the R environment and be able to perform data science in Base R and Tidyverse that includes data clearning, data exploration and data visualisation and interpret a workflow for their data analysis:

- interact with the R environment
- import data, explore it and summarise it
- explore data with graphs

## Prerequisites

_Required Knowledge_

As it is a course for beginners, no background in R or any programming language is required. However, you are encouraged to go through some of the R documentation available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html). Please take note that this course is NOT a training on statistics but rather a training on how to use R to visualise data graphically.

_Technical_

If you don't have R installed in your local computer, you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), a cloud-based version of R and RStudio available through your web browser. So the webinar day, all you need is **a laptop that can access the internet**.  Please do [sign up for an account on RStudio Cloud](https://login.rstudio.cloud/register?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.login.rstudio.cloud%2Foauth%2Flogin%3Fshow_auth%3D0%26show_login%3D1%26show_setup%3D1) before the webinar. You can make an account directly on RStudio Cloud, or use single-sign-on with a service like GitHub or Google. 

Or You can alternatively have a local R and RStudio IDE installation on your computer as backup in case you might not have access to the internet during the session. We recommend that you install the following:
 
1. A recent version of R (~4.0.2), which is available for free at [cran.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org)
2. A recent version of RStudio IDE (~1.3.1093), available for free at [www.rstudio.com/download](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. The set of relevant R packages, which you can install by connecting to the internet, opening RStudio, and running:  
 
    install.packages(c("rmarkdown", "skimr", "tidyverse"))

## Invited speaker 

Dr. Umar Ahmad is a PhD student of Genetics (Cancer) with Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre (GRMCR) of the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and the Malaysia Genome Institute (MGI). His work in basic and translational research is focused on developing targeted therapy for human bladder cancer with primarily focused on cancer genomics and transcriptomics through bioinformatics analyses of next-generation sequence (NGS) data such as transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. He is currently developing a R/Bioconductor package that could be used to extract bladder cancer RNA-Seq data from cancer publicly available repositories.
